# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-21

Project translated to English. All docs (README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md), shell script comments, log messages, templates, and output strings are now in English. Behavior is unchanged.

### Changed

- **All scripts** — comments, log messages, error output, and help text translated. `extract_commit_subject` in `worker-agent.sh` also recognizes the new English template placeholders as fallback markers.
- **All docs** — README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md translated.
- **Both templates** — `.tasks/_template.md` and `.tasks/_template-research.md` translated, default placeholders are now `<Short feature description — ...>` and `<short topic description — ...>`.

### Note for existing users

Tasks already in `todo/` with Polish placeholders still work — the worker's fallback in `extract_commit_subject` accepts both the old and new placeholders. New tasks should follow the English template.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-20

Feature-named commits. The worker now reads the H1 from the task file and uses it as the commit subject instead of the generic `[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-XXX.md`. The audit tag moves to an `AI-Grid: <task-name>` trailer in the commit body — `git log --oneline` is clean, `git log --grep="AI-Grid:"` still finds all AI commits.

### Changed

- **`worker-agent.sh`** — new `extract_commit_subject` function parses the first `# H1` from the task file. Template placeholders are ignored and replaced with the filename slug. Commit message: `<H1>\n\nAI-Grid: <task-name>`.
- **`.tasks/_template.md`** — hint above the H1: "THIS becomes the commit message" plus examples (`Add electrician job page`, `Refactor auth middleware`).
- **`.tasks/_template-research.md`** — same: H1 = subject.

### Migration

Old commits with `[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-XXX.md` remain as-is (history unchanged). New tasks automatically use the new format — just write a readable H1 in the task file.

### Before / After

```
BEFORE:                                       AFTER:
[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-101-job-electrician   Add electrician job page
[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-102-job-economist     Add economist job page
[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-110-org-drugs         Hide drugs section for non-orgs
```

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-20

Linear-history integration. With 14 workers the default `git merge --no-ff` produced spaghetti (28 commits + 14 parallel rails for 14 tasks). The new `integrate.sh` uses cherry-pick: each task -> one commit on main, no merge commits, with automatic worktree and branch cleanup.

### Added

- **`integrate.sh`** — cherry-picks `ai-grid/*` branches onto the current branch. Modes: single branch, `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--keep-branch`. Sanity-checks the working tree before starting; STOPS with a clear message on conflict (exit code 4), leaving remaining branches untouched. After success, removes the worker's worktree + the `ai-grid/<task>` branch.

### Changed

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — "Integration" section in "Autonomous mode": the manager uses `./integrate.sh --all` instead of `git merge --no-ff`. On conflict — break out of autonomy and ask the user.
- **`README.md`** — quickstart shows `./integrate.sh --all`, the "Cleanup" section notes that integrate.sh handles this automatically.

### Why

`git merge --no-ff` preserves "this was on a separate branch" — but in our workflow each branch has exactly 1 commit (the worker commits once), so that info is worthless. Cherry-pick rewrites the commit onto main with a new SHA but the same commit message ("[AI-Grid] Zrobiono task-XXX"). Result: readable `git log --oneline`, `git bisect` works normally, review is 1:1 with the task.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

Token-saving for the manager (Claude Code / other LLM orchestrator). The worker writes a concise per-task summary, the new `status.sh` aggregates grid state in one call, and a research task template lets you delegate codebase exploration to gemini. The manager can operate end-to-end autonomously instead of asking about every step.

### Added

- **Task summary per worker** — after the commit the worker writes `.agent-logs/<worker>_<task>.summary.md` with `WORKER`, `RESULT` (OK/AI-FAIL/TEST-FAIL/COMMIT-FAIL/NO-CHANGES), `BRANCH`, `COMMIT`, `FILES_CHANGED`, `DIFF`, `TEST_CMD`, `FINISHED` + the file list. The manager reads 16 lines instead of the full AI log (~3–5x savings in the review phase).
- **`status.sh`** — one-call status report: queue (todo/in_progress/done), `ai-grid/*` branches with diff stats, large-diff flags (> `LARGE_DIFF_LINES`, default 100), locks with stale-detection (>60 min), tmux sessions, recent summaries with `RESULT`. Bash 3.2-portable.
- **`.tasks/_template-research.md`** — research-task template: gemini explores the specified scope, writes a report to `.tasks/research/<slug>.md` (TL;DR + Findings + Recommendations, max 300 words). Manager consumes the summary instead of reading raw code (~5–10x savings in the discovery phase).
- **"Autonomous mode" section in `CLAUDE.md`** — instructions for an LLM manager: plan -> launch `./launch-grid.sh --no-attach` yourself -> poll `.tasks/done/` -> review via `./status.sh` + summary files (not full logs) -> auto-merge for diffs < `LARGE_DIFF_LINES` -> ALWAYS ask before `git push`.

### Changed

- `worker-agent.sh` — added the `write_task_summary` function called at each terminal of `execute_task` (success / AI-fail / test-fail / commit-fail / no-changes).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

First public release. A local **multi-agent coding grid** built exclusively from native tools: Bash, the filesystem, `tmux`, gemini CLI. Spawn N AI workers in parallel — each in an isolated git worktree, each committing to its own `ai-grid/<task>` branch.

### Highlights

- **Atomic locking via `mkdir`** — POSIX-atomic guard. Two workers seeing the same file in the queue never claim it concurrently. No `flock`, no SQL, no Redis.
- **Worktree per worker** — each worker operates in `.worktrees/<worker-id>/`. No shared working tree -> no race on `git add -A` or file conflict between concurrent gemini instances.
- **Branch per task** — `git checkout -B ai-grid/<task-name> $BASE_SHA` before each task. Merge what's good, drop the rest.
- **Crash-safe** — `trap EXIT/INT/TERM` returns the task from `in_progress/` to `todo/` and releases the lock on SIGINT/SIGTERM/exception.
- **Stale-lock cleanup** — `launch-grid.sh` removes locks older than 60 minutes at startup (for workers that died before their trap fired).
- **Pluggable AI backend** — the `run_ai()` function at the top of `worker-agent.sh` is the adapter — swap for claude-code, ollama, llm, or anything else.

### Components

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `launch-grid.sh` | Tmux orchestrator: `--workers N`, `--no-attach`, old-lock cleanup |
| `worker-agent.sh` | Single worker (claim -> AI -> tests -> commit -> done) in worktree |
| `.tasks/_template.md` | Task template (Goal / Context / Files / Definition of Done) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Instructions for Claude Code as manager (optional) |
| `README.md`, `LICENSE` | Documentation + MIT License |

### Requirements

- bash 4+ (5+ recommended)
- git, tmux
- gemini CLI ([Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)) — tested on 0.42.0, one-time `gemini auth login`

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brbn-jpg/claude-conductor.git && cd claude-conductor
cp .tasks/_template.md .tasks/todo/task-001-something.md
$EDITOR .tasks/todo/task-001-something.md
./launch-grid.sh --workers 2
```

### Known limitations

- **Workers exit when `todo/` is empty** — they don't run as daemons. For background daemons reacting to new tasks, replace `break` with `sleep "$POLL_INTERVAL"; continue` in the worker's main loop.
- **No retry counter** — a crashed AI task returns to the queue with no limit.
- **Stale-lock threshold is hardcoded (60 min)** — bump `STALE_LOCK_MINUTES` in `launch-grid.sh` for long-running tasks.
- **`gemini --yolo` = full trust in the AI**. The framework isolates workers via worktrees, but the prompt's quality (the DoD in the template) determines output quality.
- **Scripts assume they live at the target repo root** (`REPO_ROOT="$SCRIPT_DIR"`). Reusing in another repo = copy the files there (see README).

### Acknowledgments

Inspired by a Reddit thread on lightweight multi-agent setups. Built on the principle "how much can you squeeze out of native POSIX tools before reaching for an orchestrator".
